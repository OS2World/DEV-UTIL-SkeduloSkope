<p>Note: This project is far from complete, for various reasons but primarily
because I have been unable yet to resolve certain behaviours of the OS/2
Control Program API. The source code is commented with the problems, and
any constructive input is <a href="mailto:sant@OS2World.com" alt="mailto:sant@OS2World.com">welcome</a>.
<p>OS/2 is about multitasking and it does it incomparably better than you
know what <i>and</i>&nbsp; Linux. OS/2 is also about multithreading, which
is much of a likeness, but still different.&nbsp;<img SRC="SkeduloSkope16.png" ALT="SkeduloSkope" height=16 width=85 align=CENTER>
started as a little hack to investigate why processes whose priority I
boosted with the ReNice add-on for Watchcat, still failed to run as expected.
And also because I saw some documentation from a normally impeccable source
that was obviously wrong, but I wouldn't have wanted to challenge without
solid proof to the contrary ! As it grew I discovered more subtleties of
the scheduler until it became&nbsp; a very instructive mini-app. While
a single instance gives good insight into inter-thread scheduling, to gain
insight into inter-process scheduling one needs to run 2 or 3 instances
simultaneously.

does not perform any undocumented "tricks" so it should run without causing
any damage to your system. However, it does <i>unusual</i> things. Like
running more than a thousand threads; like running a large number of Time
Critical threads. Do not even think of running it if you are also running
some application that needs regular access to the CPU, like writing a CD
or running your pet heart-lung machine. It has often hung itself in development
on my system but never interfered with other apps I might have had running.
Nevertheless, before you first start it, as you should do with any new
app you run anyway, make sure all your work is saved first in case you
have to reboot. Use a small value for the first parameter until you know
what effect it has. OS/2 will <b>not</b> respond to <b>any</b> keys, not
even PAUSE, ^C, C-A-D or WatchCat keys while running TimeCritical threads
(at least not any time soon). So if you enter large values on a slow machine,
you might need to press hardware reset, cycle the power or <i>go shopping
!!</i> of course.
<br>It may happen, why I cannot tell, but suspect the scheduler code (because
a similar thing can happen with just any other old app) that the program
will just hang sometimes, hundreds of threads scheduled but the system
won't let them run. This won't interfere with your system (apart from using
up your available threads) but it cannot be killed except by reboot.
<p><u>This is why it's &szlig;eta:</u> In the 160x38 mode, some priority
levels, apparently random but always the same on my machine, will hang
the app. If you look at the screen when it is ready to run, you'll see
some "teeth missing" from the display, and if you inspect the source code
you'll see IF statements to prevent those particular priority levels from
using the display. If you know what causes this behaviour and how I can
get it fixed, please let me know.
<p><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" ALT="!" ><u><font size=+2> Warnings for more serious
implementers:</font></u>
<br>Running better than the default 80x25 "mode",&nbsp; especially running
several instances, allows one to get a better feel for the scheduler, but
many a Config.SYS will not allow you sufficient threads. This is fixed
by changing the THREADS= line in your Config.SYS. I believe the default
is 1024 but see what yours is first and REM it to remember what it was
should you want to go back before entering a new value. <b><font color="#990000">Ensure
you can start your system with stiffies/maintenance partition/bootable
CD/or any other alternative means <i>before</i> you fiddle with your THREADS=
line. TIP: When you next reboot your system, press Alt-F1 when booting
starts, then F2 to see if </font></b>\OS2\BOOT\Config.X&nbsp;<b><font color="#990000">
still boots your system.</font> If it does not, you can copy your current
<i>working</i>
Config.SYS over there.</b>
<p>The MAXWAIT= line also affects scheduling; The value is given in seconds
(default=3) which is fair for a slow 386 but the minimum, 1, is hardly
appropriate for today's machines. While watching the display for <b>FS</b>
and <b>Reg</b> threads you will notice they all run a little, periodically;
the period is what you specify for MAXWAIT here. TIP: You might as well
change permanently to MAXWAIT=1 unless you're running an i386.
<p>My system has THREADS=1312 so it is likely yours will handle that too,
but beware, specifying too large a number will use up GDTs that other parts
of the system need. When you boot with too large a number for THREADS=,
you'll see messages from many device drivers not being able to load. Don't
keep on pressing enter, your system won't run. Press C-A-D, restart from
your alternative means and tedit config.sys to reduce the number. When
you are through with&nbsp;<img SRC="SkeduloSkope16.png" height=16 width=85 align=ABSCENTER>,
it may be a good idea to reduce your THREADS= setting to something like
512 or 384. Even power-users hardly ever have more than 200 threads going
at once and it does use up a limited resource, GDTs (Global Descriptor
Table entries, to be precise) as well as address space (would you believe
it, 4GB and we're running short !) as well as just plain old RAM.

<p><u><font size=+2>The parameters</font></u>

e.g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SkeduloSkope 1000 2000"</font>
<p>There are two, both integer numbers from 0 to 2<sup>31</sup> ( but realistically,
no more than about 1 000 000 ).
<p>There are two distinct categories of priorities under OS/2:
<ol>
<li>
&nbsp;The TimeCritical and the Idle classes share the characteristic that
there are no priority boosts; thus a TC+3 thread will not get <i>any</i>
CPU while there are "ready" TC+4 and better threads.</li>

<li>
The ForegroundServer and Regular classes use a complex algorithm to determine
who should run. For this reason, one would want a small number for the
first category (they run in a simple order from top to bottom) so that
it runs quickly;To adequately observe the other two classes though, one
would want a large number so that they run for longer.</li>
</ol>
The numbers and the period of observation they afford are of course directly
related to CPU speed. So for a 386SX16 !! you would probably not want to
go beyond 200 800 for a start; On your new GHz Athlon those numbers will
get you only a few seconds worth of display, so try 2000 5000 at first
and perhaps 1000 20000 later to see the priority boosts.
<p><u><font size=+2>The program</font></u>
<br>What it does is to start some threads at all the possible priority
levels and then to display them running for your observation. Three "modes"
are supported: Normal 80x25 VIO window size (will also run F.S.), 160x20+
and 160x37+. In the 80x25 mode, 256 threads (two per level) is started
and prepared "ready to run" and blocked on an event semaphore which gets
posted as soon as you press a key. This pause also gives one the opportunity
to start more instances of&nbsp;<img SRC="SkeduloSkope16.png" ALT="SkeduloSkope" height=16 width=85 align=ABSCENTER>
(regardless of <i>their</i> "mode"), which, on detecting a "Master" instance
already owning the semaphore, will block all it's threads on the same evsem
so <b><i>all</i></b> the threads of <b><i>all</i></b> the instances eventually
start together, provided you don't start the master before all the slaves
are ready. The 160x20 mode uses 3 threads per priority level (and more
significant digits) to afford a more detailed display. The 160x37 mode
use 6 threads per priority level, but it is <i>kludged</i> not to hang.
<br>Each thread (and thus priority level) has a given place on the display
where it displays it's diminishing number when it has the CPU. The space
is labeled with the priority e.g. R07 indicates regular+7. There are also
a few help screens when the program is run without parameters.
